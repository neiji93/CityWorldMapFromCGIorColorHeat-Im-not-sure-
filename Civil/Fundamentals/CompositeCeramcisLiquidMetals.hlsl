//This seems gracefully not a CG function !
//Then, the random corpus will be diffeomorphisms. And in physics, diffeomorphisms
//can occur in high school formulas. So, just return if the  parameters contain high school formulas.

//as the light can enter the ground and as we experiences CGI tehnciques too, we can now modelize
